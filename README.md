Hello, my name is Anna,

I am a novice web developer. Currently, I am working on educational and non-commercial projects at Yandex Practicum. In my free time, I study new libraries and frameworks.

1. I have already studied: HTML, CSS, SCSS, responsive design, cross-browser layout, JavaScript, Git, Webpack, React, Redux, Versel, Next.js, GitHub pages, API.

2. In the near future, I plan to study: TypeScript, Node.js.

3. I enjoy working on both the appearance and logic of websites. I am looking for a team where we can learn from each other's experience, work on challenging goals, and develop into top-notch professionals.

4. I love creating stylish, animated, responsive websites that are comfortable and enjoyable for users. That's exactly what I want to build.
