I have experience working with a range of technologies including __HTML, CSS, SCSS, responsive design, cross-browser layout, JavaScript, Git, Webpack, React, Redux, Versel, Next.js, API, Web-Socket and GitHub pages.__

As a web developer, I believe in constantly improving my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends. I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools to enhance my abilities and deliver high-quality results.
