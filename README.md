Hello, my name is Anna,

I am an aspiring web developer with hands-on experience working with various technologies. Currently, I am actively involved in building educational and non-commercial projects at Yandex Practicum. In addition, I am always eager to learn and improve my skills to stay up-to-date with the latest web development technologies.

I have experience working with a range of technologies including HTML, CSS, SCSS, responsive design, cross-browser layout, JavaScript, Git, Webpack, React, Redux, Versel, Next.js, and GitHub pages.

As a web developer, I believe in constantly improving my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends. I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools to enhance my abilities and deliver high-quality results.

In the near future, I plan to expand my expertise to include TypeScript and Node.js.

I am passionate about creating visually appealing, dynamic, and user-friendly websites. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals in a team environment, where I can learn from their experiences and work together towards challenging goals.
